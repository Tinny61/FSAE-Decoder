# FSAE-Decoder
This Program decodes CAN codes that are passed into it
1.) First we will pass the data into a two dimensional vector and then "if"/"if else" statements will decode the data.
		(Before moving onto next step make sure everything can decoded)
			(In this version I used arrays to test the functions that will decode the data)
			
2.) After the program is able to decode the CAN codes then a GUI will be devolped with graphs.
		Check out: https://www.qcustomplot.com/ for graphing libraries?
		
3.) Try and keep the main as simple as possible. This means you'll need to call functions (Maybe make other headerfiles?)

4.) Once everything is coded create a .exe file so that the program can be used without the need of Visual Studio
